abstract:
  - "Without an elite-driven public opinion movement within the next five years, we will likely never see appropriate, peer-reviewed, scientist-backed federal emission reductions in the US."
  - "Oil companies are the behavior interventionists that we are 'up against'."
  - "If behavioral insight can be used to delay climate action, it can also be used to force it."
