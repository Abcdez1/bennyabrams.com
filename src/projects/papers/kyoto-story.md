abstract:
  - "Although its second commitment period came to an end on 31 December 2020, and it has, to all practical intents and purposes, now expired, the Kyoto Protocol remains a key milestone in the evolutionary development of the international climate change regime."
  - "Eventual agreement and entry into force were arguably only possible based on the broad political agreements reached in Kyoto."
  - "The Kyoto Protocol's limitations, therefore, stemmed not only from the withdrawal of a key party but also from the collective unwillingness and inconsideration of negotiating to build a truly global coalition."
