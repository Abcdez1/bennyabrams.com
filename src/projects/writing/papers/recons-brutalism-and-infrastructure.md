abstract:
  - "Buildings are built to be used in the future - this inherently means the architects and designers must make a prediction about what this future might look like. The infrastructure of this campus gives a view into the priorities and perspectives of the people and administrations across history."
  - "I was also hesitant to write this article at first; it was too limited in scope. Isn’t the point of a college economics newsletter to polemicize against the system? (Or maybe unapologetically support it?) To make sweeping conclusions on the nature of international conflict? Something new. Something novel. Something now. We arguably already hear more than enough about Rutgers - we go here. But the more I thought about it, the more I realized the aging, beautiful, and contentious infrastructure of Rutgers is everything that I love about economics."
  - "But these buildings are a core piece of Rutgers history. Of academic history. Of American history. Their reason for existing was a result of specific economic and political priorities of the time; their design reflected not only an architectural movement but a philosophical one. Movements that, in their own way, seek to answer how we should interact with our environments. How we should build and create. How we should allocate resources. These questions economists were trying to answer, in their own way, at the same time."
  - "Economics does not just talk about Pareto optimality and efficiency. It talks about equity and fairness, too. So, when we look at the technicals of institutional planning and operations spreadsheets, we do not just evaluate whether we can afford our buildings. We assess whether we will be able to afford our buildings. Whether our future legacy children will be able to afford our buildings. Whether our earth will be able to afford our buildings."
