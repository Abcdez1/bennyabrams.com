Synthesizes historical, legal, and policy perspectives on U.S. emissions trading.
Talk intended for fellow students and faculty based on class research and research poster.

The full project also includes more on the history of theory of emissions trading (history of economic theory on externalities from ancient philosophy up till Coase, conceptualization of fair market structure, formalization of theory, early sulfur dioxide emissions trading systems and the Clean Air Act), the role of the U.S. in developing emissions regulation and international agreements (focus on three periods: pre-UNFCCC in the U.S., Kyoto, and Paris), the polarization of climate change in the U.S., and the effective nature of emissions markets in both actually limiting emissions and redistribution back to helping consumers afford energy.
